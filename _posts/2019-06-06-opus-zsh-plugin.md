title: Opus Zsh Plugin
---
The zsh plugin previously named workon is now known as Opus. I have started working with more Python and ran into name collisions with virtualenv's `workon` command.

Why Opus? Well the definition of Opus is "a work." It may not be my magnum opus, but it didn't seem to have too many shell name collisions. Thankfully if you don't like the name you can just alias it to whatever your liking.

You can get it on [Github](https://github.com/bryanculver/opus.plugin.zsh).

I've renamed the previous repository but have tagged this release as `v2.0`.
