Some of my brilliant coworkers and I were guests of the "Network to Code on Network Collective" podcast series. We talked about many things regarding enterprise processes (people and technical) and how to not only deliver network automation in those environments, but overall evolution as well.

They ([Daryn Johnson](https://twitter.com/Dirtyonekanobi), [Rick Sherman](https://twitter.com/shermdog01), and [Jordan Martin](https://twitter.com/bcjordo)) said some really smart stuff. I just tried to keep up.

You should check it out!

And while you're there you should subscribe to [Network Collective](https://networkcollective.com). There's a bunch of great stuff there that Jordan Martin is cooking up.
